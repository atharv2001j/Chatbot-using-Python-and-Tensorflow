# Chatbot-using-Python-and-Tensorflow
This code is an implementation of a simple chatbot using TensorFlow, which is a machine learning framework developed by Google. The chatbot is trained using a neural network to classify user inputs into predefined intents and provide appropriate responses based on the detected intent. 

Steps for the Implementation of Chatbot:
1. Create a virual Environment by executing following command on command prompt:
    python -m venv chatbot

2. Activate the Virtual Environment
    chatbot\Scripts\activate

3. Create an JSON file in which you have to store the intent for the chatbot in the format:
		tag:[]
		pattern:[]
		response:[]
		context:[]

4. Create a new.py inside the chatbot folder in which we perform operations like:
   Lemmatization,Stemming and Bag of words (BoW)

5. Install neccesary libraries which is mention in requirements.txt

6. import all libraries. 

7. for next instructions refer the new.py file.

8. Create another file chatbot.py in same folder

9. Save all the Models

Note: You can add the intents as per your requirements.
